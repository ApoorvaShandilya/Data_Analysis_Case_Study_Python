**Project Description**
A company called Eniac is an an e-commerce tech company.
As a Data analyst we have to dig into data provided from Eniac and help the company settle  on going debate :
**whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.**
The **Marketing Team Lead**is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, 
and allow the company to grow.
The main **investors** in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results 
showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the
lowest prices in the market.
